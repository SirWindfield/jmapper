==Extension Annotation==
If you'll write a Plugin or Module the associated annoatation has to annotate `PluginExtension` or `ModulExtension`. So JMapper can recognize the type of Extension by the annotation. 

==InstallExt==
Cause of the new annotations, I was able to write a new install-routine: `JMapper#installExt(Class<?> class)`. If you use this Methode, JMapper will look for implemented Interfaces and if there is a Module or Plugin, it will install it correctly. 

==Update Module==
Now you can update your Module after plugins had done their work. MapperModule got a new Method which will be called after all plugins were invoked. So e.g. the Linkmodule is able to use Plugins for Setter-Methods.

==Super Exception==
If JMapper needs to throw an exception, it will be an exception inheriting JMapperException.
