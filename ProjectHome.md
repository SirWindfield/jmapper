JMapper allows you to define read/write-rules for any property in your map by linking an interface to a map. Here is a list of what you can do:

  * Recognizes java beans
  * Creates getter/setter and link them to an map-entry
  * Allows to combine getter/setter with parser (e.g.: get the text of an JTextField)
  * Knows adapters, so the keys of the map don't have to be Strings
  * modular
  * you're able to write your own plugins and modules
